                            <p>
                            Onion belongs to the Amaryllidaceae family with botanical name Allium cepa.
                             Onions are easiest to grow from bulbs, but it is also possible to grow them
                              from seeds. Onions are an important food crop worldwide. 
                              Quality of Onion seeds  depends on several factors, such as environmental conditions 
                              during growth of mother plant and seed development, location of seeds on the
                               plant, time of seed .

                            <p className="onion-para">
                            Onion seeds can be kept for 2 years in a cool and dry place such as a properly monitored seed storage box. 
                            Onion seed germination rates
                            fall as the age of the seed, and though they have 3-year-old Onion seeds that sprouted well, germination is always highest with fresh seeds. Though, purchase a fresh bag of seed-starting mix each spring as a safety precaution against soil-borne diseases. Onion seedlings stay in pots for up to 10 weeks, so use a soil medium that’s unlikely to host diseases.
                            </p>

                            The optimum Onion spacing is 15 cm between the rows and 10 cm between plants. Seeds are drilled on the rows opened at 10cm space and 0.5 to 1cm depth against the bed length and slightly covered with soil. 
                            An Onion seed rate
                            of 4 to 5 kg is sufficient for raising seedling required for one-acre land.

                            <p className="onion-para">
                            Onion seed starting is very easy. Onions grow best in fertile, well-draining soil and this should also be worked with 
                            organic matter such as compost.Seeds can be planted directly in the garden bed. Though, when growing Onion seed, some people prefer to start them indoors. This can be done in late autumn and the 
                            best time for planting Onion seeds
                            outdoors is in spring, as soon as the soil can be worked in your area. Put them about an inch (2.5 cm.) deep in the soil and about half an inch or more apart. If planting rows, and space them at least one and a half to 2 feet apart.
                            Onions are cool-season and biennial plants, but they are grown commercially as an annual crop. The 
                            Onion seeds germinate
                            during the first season and the plants grow vegetatively, eventually forming a bulb. Although Onion seeds will germinate at temperature level as low as 2°C, a temperature of at least 13°C is required for 70 percent seedling emergence within 2 weeks of planting. The optimum
                            temperature range for Onion seed germination
                            , emergence, and plant growth is 20° to 25°C. The early 
                            growth rate of Onion plants
                            is slow compared to other cool-season 
                            crops  due to slow leaf area development and low light interception.
                            <br></br>
                            When it comes to Onion seed germination
                            , temperature plays an active role. While typically germination occurs within 7 to 10 days, soil temperature affects this process. For instance, the cooler the soil temperature, the longer it will take for Onion seeds to germinate up to 2 weeks. Warm soil temperatures, on the other hand, can trigger Onion seed germination in as little as 4 days.
                            Once seedlings have sufficient leaf growth, thin them down to around 3 to 4 inches apart. 
                            Transplant Onion seedlings
                            that were started indoors about 4 to 6 weeks before the last expected frost or freeze date, provided the ground is not frozen. Onion plants have shallow roots and need frequent 
                            irrigation  throughout the growing season. However, once the tops begin to layover, usually by late summer, watering must be stopped. At this point, Onions can be lifted and 
                            growing Onion seed plants
                            is an easy, inexpensive way to keep an unlimited amount of Onions on hand just when you need them.

                            <h3 className="onion-title">Seed Treatment of Onions</h3>
                            <p className="onion-para">
                            Seed treatment with Thiram by 2 gm/kg of seed + Benomyl 50WP by 1 gm/liter water effectively controls damping-off and smut diseases. After chemical treatment, seed treatment with bioagent Trichoderma viride by 2 gm/kg of seed is recommended, it helps in reducing early seedling diseases and soil-borne inoculums. 
                            Treating Onion seed  with a fungicide like Apron Star is recommended to avoid fungal diseases like damping off.
                            Seed treatments and enhancements can improve stand establishment, survival, quality, and appearance of Onions. Seed enhancements contain seed priming and seed coating procedures. Seed treatment insecticides and 
                            fungicides can protect crop yield  potential from losses to Onion pests and diseases.
                            Onion seed can be treated in many ways before planting to improve the quality and yield potential of the resulting crop. The term “seed treatment” refers to the application of insecticides and/or fungicides to the seed to help protect the seeds and young seedlings from insect pests and fungal pathogens. On the other hand, the term “seed enhancement” refers to other processes, such as seed coatings or pelleting, seed priming, or post-priming procedures that are intended to improve the handling and planting of the seed, reduce the time to termination, and increase the uniformity of seedling emergence. And non-treated Onion seed is also available.
                            The first step in germination is the imbibitions of water by the seed and these imbibitions of water start the physiological processes that allow the seed to break dormancy and germinate. One way to 
                            speed the process of Onion seed germination
                            after planting is by priming the seed before planting. Seed priming is defined as pretreatment of seeds by different methods to improve seed germination rate, percentage germination, and improve the uniformity of seedling emergence by controlling the water available in the seed.
                            Typically seeds are soaked in a water solution to start the germination, but then they are dried before they sprout. Once planted, primed seed emerge quickly and more uniformly than non-primed seed. However, priming usually shortens the 
                            shelf-life of the Onion seed
                            , so seed should be planted within 6 to 12 months of priming.
